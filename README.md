## About Myself
Enthusiastic professional with 4+ years of proficiency in Software Testing(manual) specialized in SOAP & REST API testing.
Now, I wish to extend my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I'm intensively studying Test Automation tools by attending online courses from learning platforms. I would be extremely happy to apply obtained knowledge to testing an operational product and gain hands-on experience. It is a crucial step in my current career goal to become a senior-level software tester in upcoming years.
